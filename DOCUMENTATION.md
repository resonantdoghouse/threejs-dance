# CodePen Forge
_Transform raw code into a browser-ready preview... offline_

This package contains all of the original code ([src/](./src/)), the original in-browser preview ([dist.bak](./dist.bak)), and _CodePen Forge_, a custom build process with preprocessors. You'll be able to edit and build for a local CodePen-like experience.

## Installation

Ensure you have a recent version of [node & npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) installed.

All of the following steps run on the command line within this directory. You can substitute `npm` for `yarn` depending on your preferences.

Install all the necessary packages:

```
npm install
```

## Build

To build for distribution:

```
npm run build
```

All of the final output will be dropped into the [/dist/](./dist) folder.

## Server

Run a local server that will automatically compile your code & refresh when you save a change!

```
npm run serve
```
